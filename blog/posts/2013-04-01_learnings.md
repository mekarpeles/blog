This is the story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute just sit there, to tell you how I strategically directed a conversation with my mother from the origins of Yiddish to orthonormality and finally Diophantine equations. 

TLDR; Things I learned today: Cauchy–Goursat theorem, holomorphic functions, "orthos" etymology, orthonormality, norms (ideal norms, euclidean norms, etc.), ideals, ring theory, and more.

While on a car ride with my mother, while discussing the origins of yiddish, I stumbled across a word I had heard before but never understood: orthography. -graphy means writing, but ortho?

* the etymology of "orthos" is: correct / straight / upright (perhaps also "to straighten"). Makes sense. Orthodontics, orthopedics, orthonormality... Wait, orthonormality?

* this lead me to lookup orthonormality which is a property of vectors who are orthogonal (perpendicular) and unit vectors. The idea is rooted in normed vector spaces. Wait, normed? 

* A norm in functional analysis or linear algebra is essentially a "map that assigns lengths to vectors". More formally, it is "a function that assigns a strictly positive length or size to all vectors in a vector space, other than the zero vector (which has zero length assigned to it)."

* As a corollary to my learnings I was taught, "A seminorm, on the other hand, is allowed to assign zero length to some non-zero vectors (in addition to the zero vector)"

* Back in the land of orthonormality, I stumbled upon a nice little proof which uses Gram-Schmidt's theorem. Ah yes, Gram-Schmidt's... Wait, what?

* Gram-Schmidt theorem is used for orthonormalising a sets of vectors in an inner product space. Oh duh, right... (while exploring norms, I stumbled across Cauchy who will become significant later)

* The wikipedia disambiguation for norms then kindly introduced me to "ideal norms" and thus "ideals" from commutative algebra which, in turn, exposed me to ring theory, Dedekind domains, prime ideals, and Krull's Theorem.

I spend the rest of my night on prime ideals: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_ideals 

I finally got home and read a post by Jonathan Godbout about the Cauchy–Goursat theorem and coformal maps / regular / holomorphic functions.
