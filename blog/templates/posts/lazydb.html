	LazyDB is a basic wrapper around the Python <code>shelve</code> flatfile
	dbm module. LazyDB provides a couchdb/S3 like layer of
	abstraction around shelve, allowing convenient access (read
	and write) to shelve without sacrificing the convenience of
	writing pickled python objects to disk.
      </p>

      <p>
	From the <code>help(shelve)</code> documentation: A "shelf" is a
	persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with dbm
	databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be
	essentially arbitrary Python objects -- anything that the
	"pickle" module can handle. This includes most class
	instances, recursive data types, and objects containing lots
	of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Disclaimer: I wouldn't suggest using this module for
	production projects as I predict it having difficulty
	scaling. LazyDB is ideal for supporting smaller projects with
	light data in which the programmer must move quickly and
	intends to implement an alternate db solution sooner rather
	than later. The intent is to provide a more elegant interface
	for utilizing the shelve module, not to create an efficient
	replacement.
