    $# 3 stages of development (1) find data people want / value -- analytics, etc, (2) find out how to maximize the data's value + refine it (DM/AA, Dedupe, ML, Stats), (3) Interface - accessibility, consumability, apis, reduce friction.

      <h1>A Greyhat's Doctrine</h1>
      <p class="by">Mek, September 18, 2012</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Enthusiasm is a powerful feeling. It can motivate us to act
	impulsively, to overcome shyness, and drive us insistently to
	persevere. However, enthusiasm, like a drug, comes in
	different doses and has side effects; both good and
	bad. Enthusiasm can blur one's vision, causing the boundaries
	which define our principles to bend, bleed, and distort. On
	one hand, it may give us the courage to step outside our
	comfort level, to experiment with / find exceptions (or
	deviations) within our belief system. However, it can also
	drive us to lose perspective, become desensitized, and impair
	our ability to think objectively.</p>

      <p>Like symbolic logic systems, our thought process is governed
	by a set of axioms. These axioms represent our fundamental
	beliefs of how the universe works and are derived from our
	knowledge base of experiences and learnings. We hold these
	axiomatic beliefs to be self-evident in that we have tested
	and tried their soundness to an extend which adequately
	satisfies our needs. Such an axiom may be humans require
	oxygen to sustain life. From these axioms, these truths, we
	are able make decisions; to establish and evolve principles,
	morals, and ethics which we use to govern and justify our
	actions.
      </p>

      <p>When we leverage enthusiasm to attack a problem, we are
	acting under a personal bias which doesn't necessarily follow
	from our axioms. It's like eating chocolate cake because we
	enjoy it, even if doing so is detremental to our heath. Such
	behaviour can cause our knowledge bases to be poluted (in the
	form of the mutation or introduction of axioms). An
	enthusiastic video game player may be swayed to evolve an
	axiomatic understanding that gaming is intrinsicly a good use
	of time, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>That isn't to say enthusiasm is a bad thing. It is rather, a
	form of stochasticism which allows us to be unique
	individuals, resulting in the exploration of topics which
	interest us. However, like any scientific experiment, our goal
	when modifying our principle system should be to understand
	each modification to our system, as well as the implications
	that come with it. When too many changes occur at once, it
	becomes challenging to verify and affirm our existing
	axioms. As a result, I believe it perimount that one learn to
	control their enthusiasm and to seek a balance, as to maximize
	its benefits without jeopardizing one's principles.
	</p>
      
      <p>One of my life goals is to strive to live the life of a white
	hat. I ground myself by the following doctrine:</p>

      <p class="prefont">
	<strong>Above all</strong>, hack for the great benefit of others.<br/>
	Struggle not to obtain freedoms from your oppressor,<br/>
	hack to create freedoms for the oppressed.<br/>
	Pay for freedom with righteous hacks, not in blood.<br/>
	Hack abstractions such that mutually exclusive ideologies may peacefully coincide.<br/>
	Hack the present into obsolescence.<br/>
	Hack the past towards the future.<br/>
	Hack together, not each other<br/><br/>	
	And don't be afraid to get your hat a little dirty.
      </p>
